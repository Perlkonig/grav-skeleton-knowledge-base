# Knowledge Base Skeleton

***Abandonment Notice:** I'm afraid I simply don't have the time to maintain my Grav themes and plugins. Those interested in taking over should refer to the ["Abandoned Resource Protocol"](https://learn.getgrav.org/17/advanced/grav-development#abandoned-resource-protoc). Feel free to fork and replace. So long, and thanks for all the fish.*
